        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2024, TradeSphere was created out of a need for a better way to trade locally.

        <p>Our founders envisioned a platform that would simplify local trading, while also fostering a sense of community. Since then, we have grown into a trusted marketplace, helping thousands of people buy and sell goods in their local area every day.
